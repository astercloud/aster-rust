This is a rust project with crates in the crates dir:
aster: the main code for aster, contains all the core logic
aster-bench: bench marking
aster-cli: the command line interface, use aster crate
aster-mcp: the mcp servers that ship with aster. the developer sub system is of special interest
aster-server: the server that suports the desktop (electron) app. also known as asterd


ui/desktop has an electron app in typescript. 

non trivial features should be implemented in the aster crate and then be called from the aster-cli crate for the cli. for the desktop, you want to add routes to 
aster-server/src/routes. you can then run `just generate-openapi` to generate the openapi spec which will modify the ui/desktop/src/api files. once you have
that you can call the functionality from the server from the typescript.

tips: 
- can look at unstaged changes for what is being worked on if starting
- always check rust compiles, cargo fmt etc and `./scripts/clippy-lint.sh` (as well as run tests in files you are working on)
- in ui/desktop, look at how you can run lint checks and if other tests can run
